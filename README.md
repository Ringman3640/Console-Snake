# Console-Snake

This a recreation of the snake game within the Windows console. It utilizes my Menu class to provide a start screen where the game settings can be changed and saved for future reference. The settings include changing the dimensions of the playspace and changing the start position of the snake.  
I had originally made a smake program a few years ago, but this is a remade version which is slightly more optimized and includes a functional start screen.  
This program only works in Windows due to the use of System("CLS") to clear the console.
